## Description of Project


Our project is a cutting-edge file storage platform that revolutionizes the way you store, access, and manage your files. Designed with user convenience and data security in mind, our platform provides a seamless and reliable solution for individuals and businesses alike.

With our platform, you can securely store a wide range of file types, including documents, images, videos, and music. We prioritize the privacy of your files by default, ensuring that only you have access to them. However, we also offer the flexibility to make files public when needed, while maintaining strict control over who can access them.

To ensure ease of access, we have implemented a unique file access system. Once a file is made public, it is locked and can only be accessed with a designated file access code. This innovative approach eliminates the need for constant sign-ins, allowing you to access your files effortlessly, whether you're on your computer or mobile device.

Our platform boasts a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation, making managing and interacting with your files a breeze. You can preview and read various document formats, view images, play videos, and even listen to music directly within the platform. We've prioritized a seamless user experience, enabling you to accomplish your tasks efficiently.

Furthermore, our platform integrates with Appwrite as the database, ensuring secure and reliable storage for your files. Appwrite's comprehensive features, including authentication and real-time synchronization, enhance the functionality of our platform, further elevating your file management experience.

Join us today and experience the future of file storage. With our platform, you can confidently store, access, and share your files, knowing that your data is secure and readily available whenever and wherever you need it. Simplify your file management and unleash the power of secure file storage with our innovative platform.

## Challenges We Faced

Building a platform like ours certainly comes with its fair share of challenges. We understand that overcoming obstacles is a crucial part of the development process. Here are some of the challenges we encountered while creating this platform and the steps we took to address them:

Appwrite's file type handling: Appwrite's file type management can be tricky, as it occasionally changes or lacks proper mime types. To tackle this issue, we invested time in extensive research on file types and mime types. This allowed us to ensure the accurate assignment of file types and mime types, mitigating any potential bugs related to file handling.

SVG link returning HTML elements: One specific challenge we faced was Appwrite's SVG link returning an HTML element instead of an image. However, we were able to overcome this challenge by implementing clear code logic to handle the SVG files appropriately. This solution ensured that SVG files are displayed as images within our platform.

Time constraints: Time is a valuable resource, and we understand the limitations it can impose. Despite facing time constraints due to a demanding schedule, we dedicated a significant portion of our daily hours to developing this platform. Balancing work commitments with development allowed us to allocate approximately five hours each day for the past three weeks. However, unforeseen internal problems eventually consumed our remaining development time, leading to a tight schedule during the submission phase.

Lack of collaboration: Collaboration is often beneficial when working on a project of this magnitude. However, we encountered the challenge of not having additional team members willing to contribute to the development process. As a result, we took on the task of programming the entire platform from scratch independently. This required determination, perseverance, and the ability to handle the full scope of the project ourselves.

Despite these challenges, we are proud to have overcome them and built a robust file storage platform. Our commitment to research, problem-solving, time management, and self-reliance has enabled us to create professional and efficient solutions for our users.
